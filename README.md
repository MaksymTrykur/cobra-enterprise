# cobra-enterprise

This is cobra, but with a backend and a database :)

## Deploy with monkOS

To deploy just run `monk run cobra-enterprise/system`.

This will run the backend and pre-configured MongoDB database. 

## System Requirements

This will easily run on a single small instance in GCP, AWS or DO.

You can choose to put the DB on a separate small instance of your choice.
